The Pattern of Design, or A Pattern Grammar 

True design patterns create living things. Design patterns are generative.

There have been minor victories where technical design patterns are successfully and repeatably applied to application architecture and construction.

But to date, the relationships between technical design patterns and the living world in which they exist are barely recognizable. 

There are two reasons for this. 

The first is that technical design patterns are only being used to describe problem domains and solutions, and not processes. they are solution patterns where improving the actual process of design is not the point. 

The second is that the language being used by technical architects bears no relationship to the living world in which it exists. 

They are formulae without life. Automata, not art.

Christopher Alexander founded the design pattern movement. His original patterns were about how people related to their environs, while technical design patterns are entirely disconnected from people. Beyond encoding algorithms, we should be encoding human processes, workflow, the flow of the business in the patterns.

At the enterprise level, we should be describing the flow of information in effecting the cultural DNA of each organization.

Just as Alexander and his proponents identified patterns unfolding in homes, streets, buildings, tracts of land, and cities, we should be describing the unfolding of function and capability into software.

Alexander cites three values inherent in his original design pattern. "First, it has a moral component. Second, it has the aim of creating coherence, morphological coherence in the things which are made with it. And third, it is generative: it allows people to create coherence, morally sound objects, and encourages and enables this process because of its emphasis on the coherence of the created whole."

Of the moral component, "One of the things we looked for was a profound impact on human life. We were able to judge patterns, and tried to judge them, according to the extent that when present in the environment we were confident that they really do make people more whole in themselves."

Of the generative component, "to what extent does the language generate (hence produce) entities that are whole and coherent?"

Of coherence, "We were always looking for the capacity of a pattern language to generate coherence, and that was the most vital test used, again and again, during the process of creating a language. The language was always seen as a whole. We were looking for the extent to which, as a whole, a pattern language would produce a coherent entity." 

Of generative structures, "It turns out that these living structures can only be produced by an unfolding wholeness. . . . You operate on it through things that I have come to call "structure-preserving transformations,” maintaining the whole at each step, but gradually introducing differentiations one after the other. And if these transformations are truly structure-preserving and structure-enhancing, then you will come out at the end with living structure. . . . If a process doesn’t go in the structure-preserving way that I'm talking about, the result is never living structure." 

A pattern language of the worldwide web. 

[2014: I recently discovered the work of Jennifer Tidwell on human interface patterns and along with these a whole class of patterns following the principles. Within the context of their use, these qualify as coherent languages. I suppose the next step is to expand the context of the languages to also describe the variations in methodologies and implementation as patterns as well.
